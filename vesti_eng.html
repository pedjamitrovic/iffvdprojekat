						<p>Istvan Sabo, cult Hungarian director, is this year's winner of the IFF's "Belgrade Winner" award for outstanding contribution to film art. The key figure of the Hungarian film, Sabo began his career with very noticeable autobiographical films of the 1960s and 1970s, in order to make a real breakthrough on the international film scene of the 1980s, enlisting in history as the first (and almost only) Hungarian Oscar award winner.</p>
						<p>He was born on February 18, 1938 in Budapest, where he studied at the prestigious Academy of Theater and Film Arts. At age 26 he directed his first feature film, "Epoch of Illusion" (Almodozasok Kora, 1964), which won him the Best Debut Award at the Festival in Locarno. His first films were partly autobiographical - "Father" (Apa, 1966), "Lovefilm" (Szerelmesfilm, 1970) and "Street Firefighters 25" (Tuzoltó utca 25, 1973) dealt with the experiences of his generation and recent Hungarian history.</p>
						<p>In addition to the films, Sabo also testified on television, and he also directed several operas. He was one of the founders of the European Film Academy, and a professor at several world universities, including the Faculty of Dramatic Arts in Belgrade. He was awarded the Alexander Lifka Prize for outstanding contribution to film art at the 2007 Pali Film Festival.</p>
